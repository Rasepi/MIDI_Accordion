//TODO - discuss the following

### General project requirements (what we need to accomplish)

### Required Skills

I've designed this tutorial to have a relatively low barrier of entry, but I will assume you have some knowledge about the following:

- **Music**
    - If you want to build a MIDI accordion, I'm assuming you know how to play the accordion or some other musical instrument, and that you have a basic sense of fundamental music theory (e.g. notes and chords).  This is required because you will need to map the accordion keys to MIDI notes by number, and it helps to be able to hear if a chord button sounds right or not when played.
- **Arduino**
    - You don't need to be an Arduino master or even have any experience with programming or electrical engineering, but I will assume you have successfully run a basic Arduino prototype at least once and are, hence, relatively familiar with how the Arduino IDE works.  If not, I recommend picking up an Arduino Getting Started Kit, checking out the [Getting Started Guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage), and building a few prototypes to get a feel for how the Arduino works before before jumping too deep into this project.

### Required Tools

If you, like me, have never dabbed into electrical engineering before, you may not have the tools necessary to build a MIDI accordion.  Here are a list of tools I ended up using throughout the project:

- Multimeter
- //TODO

### Required Parts

Here is the complete Bill of Materials for this project.  Specifics may vary from project to project (since all accordions are different), but this should give you a good idea of what parts will be needed and about how much you're likely to spend on them:

And then jump off from here!
