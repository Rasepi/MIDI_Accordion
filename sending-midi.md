//This will be the tutorial for creating and sending midi data.  Include some info about the MIDI protocol, some info about Arduino, and detailed isntructions for using the tutorials (with link to the tutorial folder in the GitHub repo).


**Goal:** Have the Arduino send MIDI data to the computer.

**The Problem:** We need to make sure whatever data we send follows the MIDI protocol in order for the data to be interpreted properly.  We will use the [Arduino MIDI library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MIDILibrary) to make it simple for us.

**You will need:**

- Arduino (Uno, Mega, etc)
- [MIDI Accordion Tutorial](https://github.com/bvavra/MIDI_Accordion/tree/master/Prototypes/MIDI_Tutorial)
- [Arduino MIDI Library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MIDILibrary)

## Solution

The [MIDI Tutorial on the Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Midi) provides a brief overview of how MIDI data is structured, along with some links to more extensive information. /*TODO - include links*/  For the sake of this project and this tutorial in particular I'll give you the tl;dr:

- //todo

**Steps**

1. Install the [Arduino MIDI Library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MIDILibrary) to your Arduino IDE.
2. //todo

**Troubleshooting**
