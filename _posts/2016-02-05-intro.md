Hiyo!  My name's Brendan Vavra, and I started a crazy project to turn an acoustic accordion into a MIDI accordion - something I would not have thought was possible until I stumbled across [someone who did just that](https://github.com/accordion-mega/AccordionMega/wiki/Accordion-Mega-story).

If you're interested in building your own MIDI Accordion, or if you're just curious about how it was done, you can head over to the [Project Overview page](/overview) to get started, or you can check out the [GitHub Readme](https://github.com/bvavra/MIDI_Accordion) for the Reader's Digest version.  I'll also be posting blogs here every now and then - some will be in-depth retrospectives on various parts of my project, and others will be cool things can do you with the accordion when you're done.  I'll also post any updates I make to the software/hardware.

Thanks for reading, and happy squeezing!
