title: MIDI Accordion v1.2 Release
subtitle: Now with Bluetooth and Bellow Expression Support
---

Version 1.2 is up!  Now the code supports using a separate MIDI output port to communicate data via Bluetooth.  I also added support for the BMP180 - a barometric pressure sensor used to read changes in bellow pressure and convert it into changes in MIDI expression.

You can view the [full changelog here](https://github.com/bvavra/MIDI_Accordion#changelog).

Here's a video demonstrating the use of the bellows to control dynamics:

And just for fun, here's a video of the MIDI accordion sounding like a real accordion:

At this point my accordion supports all of the features present in the [AccordionMega project](https://github.com/accordion-mega/AccordionMega) (except for register shifting).  However, I'd like to continue development on this project - specifically, I want to add additional MIDI controllers (mod wheel, balance knob, instrument change buttons, etc.).  I may also add switches to allow turning the Bluetooth and BMP on and off without having to recompile the code.  I'm sure there are a ton of things I can do to add more awesome to this instrument; I'll have to keep playing around with it and see what I come up with...
