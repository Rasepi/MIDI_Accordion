YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!

After 10 months and over 250 hours of dedicated time, my MIDI Accordion has finally come to life!  Check it out!

[Demo Video #1 - Professor Layton Main Theme (Intro)](//TODO)

Now that I know my implementation works, I'm excited to share this project page with everyone to inspire other accordionists/musicians/programmers/tinkerers/etc. to do the same.  If you want to build your own MIDI accordion, check out the [Project Overview page](/overview) or the [GitHub Readme](https://github.com/bvavra/MIDI_Accordion) to get started. 

A huge thank you to everyone who inadvertantly contributed to this project by sharing all the software and tutorials I used to make it happen.  It was a very fun project, and I learned a lot.  Special thanks to [Dmitry Yegorenkov](https://github.com/accordion-mega/AccordionMega) for the priginal project and initial inspiration of which this entire endeavor is based - I literally would not have even thought this project could be feasible without your work.

I'm not done yet, though - there are still a bunch of bells and whistles I can add to enhance this accordion's ability as a MIDI instrument, and I'm super excited to design and implement them.  But first, I'm going to take some time to enjoy the fruits of my labor...
