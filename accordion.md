subtitle: Preparing your accordion for MIDI-fication

//This will be the tutorial for obtaining an accordion and preparing it for midification - this has to be a bit vague since it will differ for each accordion, but it should include
- how to find an accordion (sites, things to consider, etc.)
- how to take apart an accordion
- how to do minor repairs (unsticking buttons/keys, etc.)
- mapping out how to apply the digital circuits.
many of these will also point to other sites that have greater info already written for some of these topics.
