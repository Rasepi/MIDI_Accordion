//This will be the tutorial for testing the final product.  I'll go over what we're testing and highlight some of the issues I ran into.

### Goal

Test the final product for playability.

### The Problem

Okay, so we finally have a finished MIDI accordion... but does it actually work?  We'll need to test the following:

1. Do all keys sound?
2. Are all keys mapped correctly to their proper pitches?
3. Do any keys stick?
4. Are there latency issues?

### Solution

//need to discuss testing, and some issues that I ran into.
